          The inacessability of sustainable resources&nbsp; has always been a
          problem. Especially in the last few decades, there has been increasing
          worry in the preservation of many things, the most prevalent being the
          environment. Every year, due to many factors like deforestation, 5-10%
          of tropical species go extinct. Even though there are many factors
          like overharvesting that harm the environment, the initiative that we
          are focusing on is the excessive use of water. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p class="text_column">
          First off, when the overall goal is to conserve water, you need to
          know what is the largest consumer of it. 70% of all potable water is
          used for agricultural practices. To make sure that this does not end
          up causing the depletion of all the water on earth, we are trying to
          put innovative horticulture and aquaponics to use. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p class="text_column">
          In the modern world, there have been numerous instances during which
          we have had to adapt to the environment and how there have been
          changes in the way that we treat the environment, and that has to
          change. Our society has become so used to wasting our natural
          resources that we have become blind to the direction that our world is
          heading in. With this initiative, we hope to bring our world to a
          better place, and make sure that we can sustain ourselves comfortably
          as long as possible. &nbsp;

            Throughout history we struggled with Horticulture but now we are
            able to solve them through the use of technology and sustainable
            methods. One problem is the waste of water and raw materials. This
            issue can pose to be very difficult and could potentially become a
            disaster in the future if not taken care of properly. One way to
            solve this is to use different technologies such as soil analysis
            and irrigation using the quickly advancing technology of drones.
            This can be used in a number of ways, which makes the very expensive
            price card worth it for many. &nbsp;

            One huge problem in aquaponic farming is something as simple as the
            water tempature. The water tempature can harm and kill the fish
            inside of your farm. There are some temporary solutions like
            monitoring the air tempature and sun. The more permanant solution
            that we have created is a system that autonomously closes and opens
            blackout curtains and/or blinds whenever the heat exceeeds the set
            limit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
